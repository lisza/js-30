    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // updating the original does not update a variable set to the orignal
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // => 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // => 100 200 
    
    let name = "lisza";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // => lisza lisza
    name = "josh"
    console.log(name, name2); // => lisza josh
    
    // It works differently with arrays! When you update an array, it will reference
    // back to the original array (unlike strings, nums, booleans). Hmm.
    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // players = ["tessssst"]
    team[0] = 'Test';
    // players[0] = 'Test';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice() passed nothing makes a copy of the array
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // ES6 Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'lisza',
      age: 27
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);
    // person and captain are the same cos captain = person for objects is a reference
    //=> {name: "lisza", age: 27, number: 99} {name: "lisza", age: 27, number: 99}
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Use Object.assign({}, oldObj, { newProp: newValue })
    const captainCopy = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(person, captainCopy);

    // We will hopefully soon see the Object ...spread, in ES2017?
    const captainSpread = {...person};

    // But they're shallow copies!
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const lisza = {
      name: 'lisza',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@cnsnts',
        facebook: 'liszalisza'
      }
    };
    
    console.clear();
    console.log(lisza);
    
    const liszaCopy = Object.assign({}, lisza);
    
    // Make a deepClone if you really need it.
